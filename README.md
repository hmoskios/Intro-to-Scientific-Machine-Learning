# Intro-to-Scientific-Machine-Learning
Welcome to my repository for ME 539 - Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning (https://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/data-analytics-se). I took this course at Purdue University during the Summer 2025 semester. This repository contains my coursework assignments, which were implemented in Python.

## Technical Stack

* Programming Language: Python

* Numerical Computing: NumPy, SciPy

* Data Analysis & Preprocessing: Pandas, scikit-learn

* Machine Learning & Deep Learning: PyTorch, TensorFlow

* Visualization & Analysis: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
## Topics Covered

* **Probability & Uncertainty Modeling:**

  Probability theory as the foundation of machine learning, with Monte Carlo sampling for uncertainty propagation and decision-making under uncertainty.
  
* **Supervised Learning (Probabilistic & Deep Learning Models):**

  Bayesian generalized linear regression, logistic regression, Gaussian processes, deep neural networks, and convolutional neural networks, with an emphasis on model formulation, training, and inference.
  
* **Unsupervised Learning & Representation Learning:**

  k-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and Gaussian mixture models for dimensionality reduction, clustering, and latent structure discovery.
  
* **State-Space Models & Sequential Inference:**

  Kalman filters for time-series modeling, filtering, and prediction in dynamical systems.
  
* **Physics-Informed Machine Learning:**

  Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that integrate physical constraints directly into model training.
  
* **Bayesian Inference & Probabilistic Programming:**

  Automated Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), and variational inference to estimate model parameters and quantify uncertainty.
  
* **Model Building from First Principles:**

  Designing, implementing, and fitting models from the ground up, with a focus on interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and scientific rigor.
